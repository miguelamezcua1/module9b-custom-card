# Module 9B - Custom Profile Component

## Description
This project is a React app created using Vite. It renders a custom profile card for **Ryan Smith**, styled with inline CSS, gradients, and a button.

## What I Learned
- How to apply inline CSS with hover effects and gradients.
- Improved structuring of JSX for cleaner design.
- How to create reusable components with styled elements.

## Challenges
I initially struggled with making the card look centered on all screen sizes, but I used `flexbox` in `App.jsx` to fix it.
